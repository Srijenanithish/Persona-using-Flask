# Persona_using_Flask
## This repository shows the personality of yours while entering your name into it. Just tried  using python Flask

run using the following command
# flask run

## It runs the program in the localhost http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Then we should give the input of our name and then click the button(Click me) available down to see your results.

The first Letter of yours is taken for the personality checker.Like if your name starts with A or a ...then your personality will be predicted as something.As same for other Names also.

## Output
Trying to display the output using some deploying sites (netlify , pythonanywhere ,etc...). Hope will deploy soon and will be uploaded.
